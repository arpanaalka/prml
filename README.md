#SVM
In machine learning, support vector machines are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data 
used for classification and regression analysis. A support vector machine constructs a hyperplane or set of hyperplanes in a 
high- or infinite-dimensional space, which can be used for classification, regression, or other tasks.

Here code for SVM regression and classification is included also code for smo is included.
